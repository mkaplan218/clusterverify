Overview of the pipeline:

input data, unlabeled
->
cluster (should be algorithm agnostic)
->
is every cluster labeled?
no ->
  pick a cluster, ask user to label the centroid (kmeans)
  -> is every cluster labeled? (go back one step)
yes ->
  Are these all of the clusters?
  yes -> 
    done
  no ->
    add a cluster, re-start from clustering step, use labeled centroids as starting point

Clustering:
the nice way: we create a clustering class that the implementations can inherit from
with the following methods:
  - cluster(data, centroids, ??)
  - labelcluster(cluster, label, ??)

the not so nice way: just make a kmeans function, handle labeling in the main file

Main file:
  - takes in data
  - keeps track of centroids
  - (if we do the nice way) take in a clustering method
  - increase number of clusters
  - merge centroids if two clusters receive the same label
  - add empty centroid if not enough clusters in clustering
  - ??
